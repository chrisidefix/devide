* At the time of this writing, your Installer (currently 5b4) has to have my
  patch iu.reload-fix-v2.diff applied, else things will go very wrong with the
  reloading of modules from Installer-ified dscas3 installations.
  
  See this: http://trixie.triqs.com/pipermail/installer/2003-May/000303.html
  for somewhat more detail.
