Current ITK/VTK notes
---------------------

*****
As of 20031201: Rude bug with CVS ITK, VTK and DICOMParser.  Both ITK and VTK
use the same DICOMParser and it seems that the wrong code is being executed
at dynamic linking due to symbols being identical.  See my posting:
http://www.itk.org/pipermail/insight-users/2003-December/005716.html

Temporary fix: comment out DICOM thingies in RegisterBuiltInFactories() in
Code/IO/itkImageIOFactory.cxx

*****
As of 20031213:
If you want to use ITK along with VTK-CVS
please do the following:

1) go to
Insight/Code/BasicFilters/itkVTKImageImport.h
and uncomment/comment lines 79-82.

2) then go to
Insight/Code/BasicFilters/itkVTKImageExportBase.h
and uncomment/comment lines 52-55.
