Release 20050530 - Mon May 30 14:42:42 CEST 2005

Changes since 20050330 - released on Mon May 30 14:42:42 CEST 2005:

 * Total conversion from demand driven to event driven.
   - we now do all our own scheduling
   - what this means to the user: you HAVE to press F5 in the Graph Editor, 
     or select Network|Execute from the menu, or press the execute button
     on any of the module configuration dialog boxes to execute a network.
 * Introduced concept of module_kits, a generic way for adding libraries
   (such as VTK or ITK) to DeVIDE.
 * Module "in-place" reload feature added.
 * Graph Editor:
   - starts up by default
   - module palette merged back into main interface
 * Updates and fixes for 64 bit Linux build
 * Say something about devide.exe.manifest
 * Upgraded from wxPython 2.4.2.4 to wxPython 2.6.2.1.
 * Worked around nasty NVIDIA driver bug on Linux (some machines, all 
   driver versions from 6107 to 7667)
 * streamTracer module added.
 * More unit tests added.
 * modules directory structure more consistent.

Changes since 20041201:

 * DeVIDE ITK installer now creates two icons on desktop: one for DeVIDE
   with ITK and the other for DeVIDE without ITK.
 * You can now run DeVIDE on your quad-buffered stereo devide (e.g.
   PowerWall, CrystalEyes): startup with --stereo parameter, press '3' while
   render window focused.
 * Main help file extended: see new entries under "Useful patterns".  Other
   documentation also updated.
 * Opacity of slices in slice3dVWR can now be changed from slices menu.
 * More flow visualization: amongst other additions, slice3dVWR now has a
   slice polydata output; this can be fed through a probe and a glyph back into
   the slice3dVWR to visualise flow directly on all slices.  See help under
   "Useful patterns".
 * Many advanced volume curvature modules coded and added by Joris van
   Zwieten.  See userModules: imageCurvature, imageCurvatureMagnitude,
   imageEigenvectors, imageGradientStructureTensor, etc.
 * Now incorporating VTK ParaView-2-0-2: Cutting, but not bleeding, edge.
   We're on our way to VTK 5.0.   
 * Unit tests greatly extended, many bugs killed in the process.
 * Build system improved.
 * Fixed long-standing bug in slice3dVWR on Linux where render part would be
   incorrectly sized at module instantiation.
 * Fixed graphEditor wrong focus on drop bug.
