* Conversion to wxPython

Sat Nov 17 17:33:59 2001 Prabhu Ramachandran <prabhu_r@users.sf.net>

    (*) Now installed using distutils as a separate module.
    vtkPipeline is bundled with MayaVi and is no longer packaged
    separately.

    (*) Cleaned up the pickled output of the vtkPickler.  Also cleaned
    up the vtkMethodParser and the vtkPipeline classes.

    (*) Huge speed up (by a factor of 50 or more) in the "expand all"
    feature of the pipeline browser, thanks to Dan Blezek
    <blezek@crd.ge.com>.

    (*) Intelligently disable useless VTK warning messages that are
    shown when the pickler or the vtkPipeline code is used by turning
    these messages off using the GlobalWarningDisplay flag
    appropriately.

    (*) Fixed various bugs.

	* Version 1.1 released.

	* Added a vtkPipelineSegmentBrowser that can show a segment of a
	VTK pipeline.  Given a set of VTK objects it displays the part of
	the VTK pipeline starting from those objects.

	* Disabled setting the ReferenceCount since this is a dangerous
	thing to do.  The ReferenceCount is only displayed.

	* Cleaned up the namespace.  I no longer use from module import *
	anywhere.  So the code should be "import safe".

	* Fixed some memory issues by removing some of the circular
	references in the vtkPipeline code.

	* Fixed long standing bug in the ConfigVtkObj class wherein the
	SetAaToBb type of VTK methods would not be initialized properly.
	The update method also handles such methods now.

	* Added a set_update_method to the ConfigVtkObj class.  This can
	be used to call a particular function when anything is changed
	during the configuration.

	* Made the vtkPickler load configurations gracefully even if some
	of the saved methods don't exist in the current installation of
	VTK.

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* File Icons/coord.gif was not a GIF: fixed.

	* Changed code to use str() instead of repr().  Latest nightlies
	didnt work with repr().  Also removed variables that were named
	'str'.

	* Added support for David Gobbi's neat improvements to the Python
	bindings.  Older versions also should work fine.

	* Fixed a silly bug that caused segfaults for Readers with methods
	that have an 'InputString'.  Thanks to Marco Morandini
	<morandini@aero.polimini.it> for reporting this bug.

	* Added a new VtkShowDoc class that is used to show VTK class
	documentation by using the __doc__ attribute.  This is used to
	provide documentation while configuring any VTK object.


Sat Oct 28 15:17:22 2000  Prabhu Ramachandran <prabhu@aero.iitm.ernet.in>

	* Version 0.9 released.

	* Added a VtkPickler class that helps save and load the state of
	any VTK object.

	* Cleaned up the classes and separated the functionality to two
	separate modules, ConfigVtkObj and vtkMethodParser.

	* Added debug functions to aid debugging when strange segfaults
	occur.

	* Fixed some bugs for the various readers.

	* Forced the pipeline browser to check for Input and Source
	objects.


Sat Oct  7 21:57:22 2000  Prabhu Ramachandran <prabhu@aero.iitm.ernet.in>

	* Version 0.8 released.

	* Any configuration option of the form Set*Color can now be set
	using a GUI color chooser!

	* Improved capability of apply button in configurator by doing a
	RenderWindow.Render().

	* Added an update button to the configurator.

	* Added a refresh button to the browser.

	* Added keyboard accelerators for browser and configurator.

	* Fixed some bugs.

	
No news for earlier releases.
