Introduction
------------

DSCAS3, or the Delft Shoulder Computer Assisted Surgery third generation
software package, is a product of the DIPEX programme at the Delft
University of Technology.  Illegal distribution is strictly prohibited.

Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

Windows:
* DSCAS3 is only supported on Windows 2000, XP and newer.
* Make sure you're up to date with the latest service packs and Microsoft
  hotfixes for your specific operating system.  http://www.windowsupdate.com/
  will do all of this automatically.

Architecture note
-----------------

As is the case with all things Python, this is not absolute, but try
never to call module methods directly: always work via the
moduleManager.
