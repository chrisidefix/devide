Release 2525 - Mon Aug  7 11:47:16 WEST 2006

Changes since ng1phase1 6.8.7 T

 * Upgraded to ITK 3.2 (with WrapITK) and VTK 5.1 (pv-3-0 branch) !
 * Highlights of new modules: 
   - RegionGrowing: module emulates what MeVisLab regiongrowing does
   - FitEllipsoidToMask: module that calculates a best fit ellipsoid 
     given an image mask
   - PassThrough: can be used as a fan-out cache (see the help)
   - Measure2D: initial work on an interactive measurement tool for 2D
     medical images.
 * More tests in the unit testing framework.
 * Complete build-system (johannes) available on *ix that can build
   DeVIDE from scratch (given a fast network connection).  Use this
   if you need the complete development environment.
 * module_kits that support this API call can now be refreshed.
 * Many fixes and improvements for ASCI A17 course.
 * Finally fixed ancient 9-pixel offset routing bug thanks to Ork de
   Rooij, Jorik Blaas and Maarten Loeffler.
 * WrapITK: threw out unsigned short (0..65535) support, activated
   signed short (-32768..32767) support.  This makes more sense for
   for example DICOM datasets.
 * slice3dVWR passes an instance of itself to its output.  Thanks Paul!
 * CodeRunner now generates real exceptions during network execution
   only.

Changes since ng1phase1 6.3.9 (released on 9 march 2006):

 * New unified interface with dockable windows.  Thanks to Gerwin de
   Haan (g.dehaan|at|ewi.tudelft.nl) for significant conceptual
   contributions to the new interface and the module quick search
   described below!
 * Module quick search.  (searches in module metadata: name, keywords,
   help).  Create a module by pressing <ENTER> when you've found the 
   module that you're looking for.  Up and down arrows select other
   modules in the search results list.  You can hot-key to the module
   search with Ctrl-F.
 * Revamped Python|Shell introspection facility with multi-file tabbed
   editor.
 * the CodeRunner module.  Try it, you'll like it.
 * All DLLs are explicitly rebased on Windows, resulting in faster
   startup and significantly less memory use.
 * Upgraded to ITK 2.8, and...
 * WrapITK integration!  This next-generation wrapping interface makes
   working with ITK fun.  Really.
 * numpy, matplotlib and statistics kits
    - you can now generate Matlab-quality figures in DeVIDE
      (try some demos out by Main Menu | Window | Python Shell then
       File | Open and select matplotlib_demo 1 2 and 3 from the
       devide/snippets directory.  Execute a demo with File | Run
       current edit in the Python Shell)
    - numpy has some really fast matrix and linear algebra routines
    - statistics contains a number of useful stats routines
 * Modules can be blocked/unblocked from execution.  Select a module
   or modules and right click to see the block/unblock commands.
 * DICOM support much improved
   . See also LR|AP|HF block in slice3dVWR
   . Much more memory efficient
 * Better VTK error handling.
 * Much improved ITK to to VTK conversion.
 * New and improved About window.
 * Central help documentation (F1) ever so slightly updated.
 * As always, various bug fixes.

Changes since 20050330:

 * Total conversion from demand driven to event driven.
   - we now do all our own scheduling
   - what this means to the user: you HAVE to press F5 in the Graph Editor, 
     or select Network|Execute from the menu, or press the execute button
     on any of the module configuration dialog boxes to execute a network.
   - some modules, such as the slice3dVWR, explicitly request execution
     of the network whilst you're interacting.  This is by design.
 * Updated to VTK 5.0 and ITK 2.4.1.
 * All WX functionality has been factored out of the DeVIDE core.  This is
   part of the DeVIDE NG1 Phase 2 planning.
 * Introduced concept of module_kits, a generic way for adding libraries
   (such as VTK or ITK) to DeVIDE.
 * Module "in-place" reload feature added.  Right click on module for
   pop-up menu, select "Reload".
 * Graph Editor:
   - starts up by default
   - module palette merged back into main interface
 * Updates and fixes for 64 bit Linux build
 * On Windows XP machines with the XP look active, DeVIDE should also have
   this look and feel.
 * Upgraded from wxPython 2.4.2.4 to wxPython 2.6.2.1.
 * Worked around nasty NVIDIA driver bug on Linux (some machines, all 
   driver versions from 6107 to 7667)
 * More unit tests added.
 * modules directory structure more consistent.

Changes since 20041201:

 * DeVIDE ITK installer now creates two icons on desktop: one for DeVIDE
   with ITK and the other for DeVIDE without ITK.
 * You can now run DeVIDE on your quad-buffered stereo devide (e.g.
   PowerWall, CrystalEyes): startup with --stereo parameter, press '3' while
   render window focused.
 * Main help file extended: see new entries under "Useful patterns".  Other
   documentation also updated.
 * Opacity of slices in slice3dVWR can now be changed from slices menu.
 * More flow visualization: amongst other additions, slice3dVWR now has a
   slice polydata output; this can be fed through a probe and a glyph back into
   the slice3dVWR to visualise flow directly on all slices.  See help under
   "Useful patterns".
 * Many advanced volume curvature modules coded and added by Joris van
   Zwieten.  See userModules: imageCurvature, imageCurvatureMagnitude,
   imageEigenvectors, imageGradientStructureTensor, etc.
 * Now incorporating VTK ParaView-2-0-2: Cutting, but not bleeding, edge.
   We're on our way to VTK 5.0.   
 * Unit tests greatly extended, many bugs killed in the process.
 * Build system improved.
 * Fixed long-standing bug in slice3dVWR on Linux where render part would be
   incorrectly sized at module instantiation.
 * Fixed graphEditor wrong focus on drop bug.
