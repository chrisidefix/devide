The testing framework:
---------------------

* How to send an event

event = wxCommandEvent ()
event.m_eventType = wxEVT_COMMAND_BUTTON_CLICKED
event.m_id  = whateverId (you could just use GetId())
wxPostEvent(theButton (or perhaps its frame), event)


Miscellaneous
-------------

* cx_Freeze example command-line for DeVIDE

/c/build/cx_Freeze-3.0.1/FreezePython.exe --include-modules moduleKits.vtkKit,
modules.Viewers.histogram1D,modules.Viewers.slice3dVWR ../devide.py

alternatively, create cxf_deps.py file with necessary imports and spec this
as the only --include-module.
