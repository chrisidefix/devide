IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------

1. Yes, a badly-written module can VERY easily crash the whole DSCAS3.
   Be careful, Austin.

2. Once you have established that an input that is to be connected constitutes
   valid input data,  call its Update() method BEFORE you do ANYTHING else
   if this it as all possible.  If you do not do this, the Multi-Threading 
   Monster could come a knocking.
   
   This instant updating at connection time is not always desirable behaviour
   however.  Please experiment.  The segfaults will guide you on your journey.

   Example: connecting a vtkDecimate output to a slice3d_vwr input without
   an update in the slice3d_vwr SetInput method results in a segfault. 
   The hypothesis is that the ResetCamera updates the data, but somehow does
   not block on the call.  The Render() attempts a second update which
   obviously throws things into complete disarray.
