IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------

1. Yes, a badly-written module can VERY easily crash the whole DSCAS3.
   Be careful, Austin.

LAYOUT OF DIALOGUES
-------------------

Yes, we follow the Windows standards, simply because they're the
most widely used ones and because most of our "clients" use/will use
Windows.  Deal with it.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch09d.asp
has the low-down on button-order.  In short, the most important button
is first in its group, whether that group is horizontally or
vertically aligned on the bottom right of the dialog.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14e.asp
has details about the spacing between controls.  Everything should be
7 pixels from the edge of the dialogue box.  Non-related controls
should be 7 pixels apart, related controls 4 pixels apart and
text-labels and their associated controls should be 3 pixels apart.

Since it makes things with sizers much easier, you can do 8 instead of 7.
You'll see why. :)

NAMING CONVENTION
-----------------

1. "Protected" methods start with an underscore (_), e.g. _utilityFunction()

2. All names (methods, variables) have first word starting with lower-case
   letter, all other constituent words and phrases starting with capital, e.g.
   segmentObjectsFromImage()
   
3. wxPython event handlers will mostly take the following form:
   _handlerShowHideObject() (this is so that they're all grouped together
   when methods are alphabetically sorted)
   
4. VTK event observers will mostly take the following form:
   _observerWidgetInteraction()
   
5. Methods in a class should be alphabetically sorted as far as possible.
