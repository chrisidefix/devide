* planes (after locking to points, or maybe explicit function) should grow
  to encompass all data in their current orientation.

* It should be possible to switch on and off interaction for any selection
  of points, not always ALL on or ALL off.

* There should be some feedback w.r.t. a plane-locked motion.

* Saving/restoring: call setConfig twice on all loaded modules, once before
  and once after connection.  Make sure the widgets know with which they are
  being called.  This will enable e.g. the slice3dVWR to do its job at
  restore.

* Splash screen with progress bar showing vtk and itk import progress at
  startup.

* split out dscas3-specific version of vtkPipeline... change buttons,
  change frame icon to that of dscas3, other enhancements

- ideas for TF editor:
  * opacity curve overlaid on histogram of data
  * areas are coloured according to the colour tf
  * colour tf is edited by inserting colour samples (nothing else, so
    straight line)
  * gradient tf?

BUGS:

- on Win 2000, modules with many ports are too narrow (i.e. the font is too
  narrow, so the knobs come out the side, if you know what I mean; gimme
  a break, it's 01:50)

- nobody but the moduleManager is allowed to call executeModule; actually,
  probably no-one is allowed to call any of the other methods either
  we could hide these with a _ with a non-_ wrapper that calls the method
  via its moduleManager

- when a plane gets hidden, the interaction button should be disabled
  (else the user can muck about with interaction, and we don't want that)
  in general, make sure of consistency with show/hide and interaction

- there is still some weirdness with planes and contours not always being
  deactivated... this was too quick so I don't know how to reproduce this
  easily.

FIXED:

* attaching axis WHILST motion is active seems to break things. 

* When a slice in hidden, its contours still show.

* When an IPW is moved, the ConstrainPlaneNormals on any BoxWidgets are not
  updated.

* vtkBoxWidget GetTransform() seems to be really borked.  I've mailed the
  vtk users list with a piece of python code with which this can be
  reproduced.

* Fix ::Rotate constraining in vtkBoxWidgetConstrained.

* At the moment, an object with motion activated latches to the first active
  plane; this should obviously be cleaned up.

* connect doubleThreshold and seedConnect to slice3dVWR without any input file
  (i.e. no reader) and watch the application become unresponsive - FIXED and
  submitted patch to vtkImagePlaneWidget: 
  vtkImagePlaneWidget-planeSizeSanityCheck2.diff

* Fix the vtkBoxWidgetConstrained mess: this should derive from vtkBoxWidget;
  at the moment it's a copy with changes applied.  This is because some of
  the most important calls are not virtual.

* When an object is moved with axis to slice, its contour isn't updated
  correctly immediately.




DONE:

* object menu for sliceVWR

* compare our vtkPipelineWX with the latest vtkPipeline from Prabhu's CVS

* saving of arbitrary collection of modules, leading to network and pattern
  saving (network: complete, pattern: macro) - for this we also need
  rubber-banding
