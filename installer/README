* At the time of this writing, your Installer (currently 5b4) has to have my
  patch iu.reload-fix-v2.diff applied, else things will go very wrong with the
  reloading of modules from Installer-ified dscas3 installations.
  
  See this: http://trixie.triqs.com/pipermail/installer/2003-May/000303.html
  for somewhat more detail.

* The 5b5 that Gordon released to the mailing list on 20030513 is still broken.
  I've sent a test-case to demonstrate the problem but my hopes are not all
  that high.  We'll just stick to 5b4 until this gets resolved.

* Gordon has released an updated 5b5: This fixes the reloading problem the
  Right Way (tm)!
