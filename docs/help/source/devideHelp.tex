The DeVIDE Graph Editor is a visual programming interface where glyphs
representing the underlying DeVIDE modules can be connected together
to form new programs.  It's the most flexible way of working with
DeVIDE, short of directly interfacing with the underlying code.

This chapter will give a brief overview of graph editor usage.

\section{A few important tips}
Before we start, a few productivity-enhancing secrets of the Graph
Editor are revealed here.

\subsection{Getting module-specific help}
Many modules have module-specific help-text built in.  To see this
help-text, create the relevant module-glyph on the canvas, right click
on the module, and select ``Help on Module''.

Also remember that selected (special) modules are documented in the
chapter \helpref{Special Modules}{secSpecialModules}.

\subsection{Reading data, quickly}
Dragging and dropping certain data-files on the Graph Editor canvas
will cause the system to automatically create and configure the
applicable module.  For example: selecting, dragging and dropping a
collection of DICOM .dcm files on the canvas will result in a dicomRDR
glyph to be created and pre-configured with the list of files that has
been dropped.

\subsection{Re-using networks, quickly}
Dragging and dropping a .dvn (DeVIDE Network) file on the canvas will
instantly load the network and build it at the mouse position.  This
will not destroy any of your current networks on the canvas.

\subsection{Quick-type module find}
Select the module categories that you want to work with.  Now focus
the canvas by clicking on it with your mouse.  Modules can now be
quickly selected by typing the first few letters in their names.  Once
the module you want is highlighted, press the ``Enter'' key to place
it.

\section{A small sample network}
The Graph Editor is introduced by putting together a simple network for
rendering the 3D 0-surface of a Super Quadric.  It's far simpler than
it sounds.

\subsection{Constructing the network}
Start by building the network shown in figure \ref{figGFN}.  First
select the ``Sources'' category on the top left of the Graph Editor.
Drag and drop the ``superQuadric'' module from the modules list on the
bottom left to the canvas.  You should see the ``superQuadric'' glyph
being created.

\begin{figure}
$$\image{5cm;0cm}{figures/geFirstNetwork}$$
\caption{Your first DeVIDE network.}\label{figGFN}
\end{figure}

Now do the same for the ``slice3dVWR'' module in the ``Viewers''
category.  Note that you can select multiple categories by holding the
Shift key and clicking a category (this will select all categories between the
previous selected category and your current click) or holding the
control key and clicking (this will select the currently clicked
module along with any previously selected modules).  The module list
will contain all modules in all selected categories.  The modules are
always alphabetically sorted.

Connect the second output of the ``superQuadric'' glyph to any input
of the ``slice3dVWR'' glyph by dragging the mouse, with the left
button depressed, from the output port to the input port.  Note that
hovering the mouse pointer over any port shows more information about
that port in the status bar of the Graph Editor.

\subsection{Admiring your results}
Right-click on the slice3dVWR module and select ``View-Configure'' to
see the 3D surface representing the 0-surface of the generated Super
Quadric.  Note that this is how one activates the graphical interface
of any glyph on the canvas.  You can rotate your viewpoint around the
generated 3D object by dragging with your left mouse button.  Dragging
with the right button will zoom.  Dragging with the middle button will
pan the viewpoint.

The network can be saved by selecting ``Save'' from the ``File''
menu.  The default extension for a DeVIDE network is .dvn.

\subsection{Warping the Super Quadric}
The slice3dVWR is a very special DeVIDE module.  Because of this, its
View/Config interface is non-standard.  Right click on the
``superQuadric'' glyph and select ``View-Config'' to see a more
standard user interface.  This interface is shown in figure
\ref{figSuperQuadricView}.

\begin{figure}
$$\image{5cm;0cm}{figures/superQuadricView}$$
\caption{The superQuadric View/Config window.}\label{figSuperQuadricView}
\end{figure}

Most module View/Config windows have the set of buttons at the
bottom.  If you make any changes to any of the module parameters, you
have to click on the ``Apply'' button (in which case the parameters
will be transferred to the underlying logic) or the ``Execute''
button, (in which case the new parameters will be transferred to the
underlying logic and the module will be asked to re-perform its
executing with the modified paramaters).  Clicking on the ``Sync''
button will transfer all parameters from the underlying logic to the
GUI.  In other words, if you've made changes to the parameters but you
would like to revert them, and you haven't applied them yet, click on
the ``Sync'' button to revert.

Change the ``Phi Roundness'' parameter to $3.0$ and click on
``Execute'' or simple press the Enter key.  Pressing ``Enter'' is
effectively the same as clicking on ``Execute''.  See the results of
your changes in the slice3dVWR window.
