IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------

1. Yes, a badly-written module can VERY easily crash the whole DSCAS3.
   Be careful, Austin.

LAYOUT OF DIALOGUES
-------------------

Yes, we follow the Windows standards, simply because they're the
most widely used ones and because most of our "clients" use/will use
Windows.  Deal with it.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch09d.asp
has the low-down on button-order.  In short, the most important button
is first in its group, whether that group is horizontally or
vertically aligned on the bottom right of the dialog.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14e.asp
has details about the spacing between controls.  Everything should be
7 pixels from the edge of the dialogue box.  Non-related controls
should be 7 pixels apart, related controls 4 pixels apart and
text-labels and their associated controls should be 3 pixels apart.
