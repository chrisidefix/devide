IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------

1. Yes, a badly-written module can VERY easily crash the whole DSCAS3.
   Be careful, Austin.

2. Once you have established that an input that is to be connected
   constitutes valid input data and you're planning to connect it to
   ANYTHING that has to do with the GUI, e.g. a vtkPolyDataMapper that
   is going to map for an actor in a vtkRenderWindow, call that
   input's Update() method BEFORE you do ANYTHING else if this is as
   all possible.  If you do not do this, the following will happen:

   a. You connect everything together, the Renderer() gets the objects
      to Update()
   b. Each object that Update()s calls its progress callback
   c. The callback HAS to yield time to the GUI
   d. The visual elements get redrawn, including the Renderer(), and
      Update() gets called on the objects again, even although the
      previous invocation is not done yet.
   c. BOOM.

   This should be resolved at VTK level by e.g. Update() locking.  It
   has been reported to the developers mailing list.
