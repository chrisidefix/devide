* split out dscas3-specific version of vtkPipeline... change buttons,
  change frame icon to that of dscas3, other enhancements

- ideas for TF editor:
  * opacity curve overlaid on histogram of data
  * areas are coloured according to the colour tf
  * colour tf is edited by inserting colour samples (nothing else, so
    straight line)
  * gradient tf?

BUGS:

* Fix the vtkBoxWidgetConstrained mess: this should derive from vtkBoxWidget;
  at the moment it's a copy with changes applied.  This is because some of
  the most important calls are not virtual.

* At the moment, an object with motion activated latches to the first active
  plane; this should obviously be cleaned up.

* When an IPW is moved, the ConstrainPlaneNormals on any BoxWidgets are not
  updated.

* Fix ::Rotate constraining in vtkBoxWidgetConstrained.

* vtkBoxWidget GetTransform() seems to be really borked.  I've mailed the
  vtk users list with a piece of python code with which this can be
  reproduced.


FIXED:

* connect doubleThreshold and seedConnect to slice3dVWR without any input file
  (i.e. no reader) and watch the application become unresponsive - FIXED and
  submitted patch to vtkImagePlaneWidget: 
  vtkImagePlaneWidget-planeSizeSanityCheck2.diff


DONE:

* object menu for sliceVWR

* compare our vtkPipelineWX with the latest vtkPipeline from Prabhu's CVS

* saving of arbitrary collection of modules, leading to network and pattern
  saving (network: complete, pattern: macro) - for this we also need
  rubber-banding
