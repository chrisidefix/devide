* object menu for sliceVWR

- ideas for TF editor:
  * opacity curve overlaid on histogram of data
  * areas are coloured according to the colour tf
  * colour tf is edited by inserting colour samples (nothing else, so
    straight line)
  * gradient tf?

BUGS:


FIXED:

* connect doubleThreshold and seedConnect to slice3dVWR without any input file
  (i.e. no reader) and watch the application become unresponsive - FIXED and
  submitted patch to vtkImagePlaneWidget: 
  vtkImagePlaneWidget-planeSizeSanityCheck2.diff


DONE:

* compare our vtkPipelineWX with the latest vtkPipeline from Prabhu's CVS
