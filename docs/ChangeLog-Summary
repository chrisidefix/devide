Release 20050530 - Mon May 30 14:42:42 CEST 2005

Changes since 20041201:

 * DeVIDE ITK installer now creates two icons on desktop: one for DeVIDE
   with ITK and the other for DeVIDE without ITK.
 * You can now run DeVIDE on your quad-buffered stereo devide (e.g.
   PowerWall, CrystalEyes): startup with --stereo parameter, press '3' while
   render window focused.
 * Main help file extended: see new entries under "Useful patterns".  Other
   documentation also updated.
 * Opacity of slices in slice3dVWR can now be changes from slices menu.
 * More flow visualization: amongst other additions, slice3dVWR now has a
   slice polydata output; this can be fed through a probe and a glyph back into
   the slice3dVWR to visualise flow directly on all slices.  See help under
   "Useful patterns".
 * Many advanced volume curvature modules coded and added by Joris van
   Zwieten.  See userModules: imageCurvature, imageCurvatureMagnitude,
   imageEigenvectors, imageGradientStructureTensor, etc.
 * Now incorporating VTK ParaView-2-0-2: Cutting, but not bleeding, edge.
   We're on our way to VTK 5.0.   
 * Unit tests greatly extended, many bugs killed in the process.
 * Build system improved.
 * Fixed long-standing bug in slice3dVWR on Linux where render part would be
   incorrectly sized at module instantiation.
 * Fixed graphEditor wrong focus on drop bug.
